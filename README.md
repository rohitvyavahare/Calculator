Your assignment is to write a calculator script. You do not need to provide an interface to the
program, like a commandline or web interface. So donâ€™t loose time on parsing input in any way
or processing web forms.
Please complete the code challenge and take as much time as you need, but be sure to log how
many hours you worked on the challenge. Pay close attention to the extensibility of your code!
Requirements
- you commit the code to a online public accessible git repository (like github)
- handle binary operations, e.g. 5 - 6
- handle combinations of binary combinations, e.g. 1 + 1 - 4 * 4
- take associativity into account, first process multiplication, division and modulus, then addition
and subtraction

Not allowed
- use of eval() in PHP or similar functions in other languages that allow you to evaluate the
equation in a one-liner
Objectives
- demonstrate skills in OOP code design
- showcase development best practices
- demonstrate good algorithmic thinking
- communication skills in discussing code implementations and vision
- demonstrate insight in how code evolves over time
